abstract = {The deep ({\textgreater} 10 km) Permian to present day Perth Basin in southwest Western Australia is composed of sedimentary successions of continental to shallow marine origin. This study examines the compositional variation, weathering and provenance of the early Cretaceous Leederville Formation within the Perth Basin. Over 200 sediment samples were retrieved from two deep boreholes of {\~{}}. 350 to 530 m in depth encompassing the Leederville Formation, and analysed for major and trace element geochemistry and mineralogy. The Leederville Formation is composed of subarkosic sands, predominantly composed of quartz (64{\%}) and K-feldspars (27{\%}); silts and clays composed of kaolinite (24-54{\%}), K-feldspars (20-29{\%}) and quartz (18-40{\%}), with their compositional variation reflecting weathering, hydraulic sorting during transport, mostly subaqueous deposition and subsequent diagenesis. Most trace elements are associated with fine grained lithologies due to their occurrence within clays, sulphide or zircon. Major and trace element geochemistry suggests a typical passive margin origin with minimal intrabasinal sediment recycling. The regionally extensive Yilgarn Craton, appears to be the main sediment source for the Leederville Formation within the study area. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Equitable allocation of groundwater resources is a growing challenge due to increasing demand for water and the competing triple bottom line values placed on its use. Sustainable management of water resources comes with compromises and trade-offs of the other subsystems such as the environment and economic and social dimensions and almost ignores stakeholders' objectives and benefits. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the hypothesis that 'through a multi-agency approach and management, a comprehensive multi-agency framework (MAF) can promote optimal, sustainable and equitable development and use of water resources for present and future generations'. The framework has been successfully demonstrated in a case study at the Gnangara mound groundwater system in Western Australia and showed what can be achieved with supporting tools such as a decision support system (DSS) to facilitate and support the MAF during trade-off analysis. Without a MAF, the potential for more conflict between agencies' objectives and actions increases. A MAF and DSS allow thorough understanding of the triple bottom line impacts, ease the selection of preferred options and result in better public involvement and investment.},

abstract = {Interannual rainfall extremes over southwest Western Australia (SWWA) are examined using observations, reanalysis data, and a long-term natural integration of the global coupled climate system. The authors reveal a characteristic dipole pattern of Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies during extreme rainfall years, remarkably consistent between the reanalysis fields and the coupled climate model but different from most previous definitions of SST dipoles in the region. In particular, the dipole exhibits peak amplitudes in the eastern Indian Ocean adjacent to the west coast of Australia. During dry years, anomalously cool waters appear in the tropical/subtropical eastern Indian Ocean, adjacent to a region of unusually warm water in the subtropics off SWWA. This dipole of anomalous SST seesaws in sign between dry and wet years and appears to occur in phase with a large-scale reorganization of winds over the tropical/subtropical Indian Ocean. The wind field alters SST via anomalous Ekman transport in the tropical Indian Ocean and via anomalous air-sea heat fluxes in the subtropics. The winds also change the large-scale advection of moisture onto the SWWA coast. At the basin scale, the anomalous wind field can be interpreted as an acceleration (deceleration) of the Indian Ocean climatological mean anticyclone during dry (wet) years. In addition, dry (wet) years see a strengthening (weakening) and coinciding southward (northward) shift of the subpolar westerlies, which results in a similar southward (northward) shift of the rain-bearing fronts associated with the subpolar front. A link is also noted between extreme rainfall years and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Namely, in some years the IOD acts to reinforce the eastern tropical pole of SST described above, and to strengthen wind anomalies along the northern flank of the Indian Ocean anticyclone. In this manner, both tropical and extratropical processes in the Indian Ocean generate SST and wind anomalies off SWWA, which lead to moisture transport and rainfall extremes in the region. An analysis of the seasonal evolution of the climate extremes reveals a progressive amplification of anomalies in SST and atmospheric circulation toward a wintertime maximum, coinciding with the season of highest SWWA rainfall. The anomalies in SST can appear as early as the summertime months, however, which may have important implications for predictability of SWWA rainfall extremes. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The southwestern corner of the Australian continent has been identified as a global "biodiversity hotspot", defined as an area where "exceptional concentrations of endemic species are undergoing exceptional loss of habitat". In this paper we reconsider the reasons for this conservation priority. We briefly review significant characteristics of the flora and fauna, and the way threatening processes are escalating ecosystem stress to these conservation values. Our specific aim is to examine the ecological consequences of hydrological change, including emergent issues such as climate change, and focus on the coastal plains in higher rainfall zones where the majority of the Western Australian population resides. Here we argue that human-driven and/or climaticallydriven hydrological change deserve greater attention, since they: i) directly escalate the risk of extinction for some components of the biota, or ii) are underlying and/or contributing factors in the manifestation of other threats to the biota, and may complicate or exacerbate some of those threats (such as fire, Phytophthora and the spread of weeds). This paper briefly outlines the challenges to the region's biodiversity posed by hydrological change. We suggest a societal adoption of approaches based on water literacy will be necessary to avoid irreversible changes associated with a continued reliance on water resource developments and other energy/water intensive industrial activities. {\textcopyright} Royal Society of Western Australia 2008.},

A wetland vegetation monitoring program was established in the mid-1990s to address these issues. Vegetation Response patterns appear to be the cumulative result of groundwater abstraction, reduced rainfall and fire.

abstract = {Riparian vegetation is important for stream functioning and as a major landscape feature. For many riparian plants, shallow groundwater is an important source of water, particularly in areas where rainfall is low, either annually or seasonally, and when extended dry conditions prevail for all or part of the year. The nature of tree water relationships is highly complex. Therefore, we used multiple lines of evidence to determine the water sources used by the dominant tree species Eucalyptus camaldulensis (river red gum), growing in riparian and floodplain areas with varying depth to groundwater and stream perenniality. Dendrometer bands were used to measure diel, seasonal, and annual patterns of tree water use and growth. Water stable isotopes ($\delta$2H and $\delta$18O) in plant xylem, soil water, and groundwater were measured to determine spatial and temporal patterns in plant water source use. Our results indicated riparian trees located on relatively shallow groundwater had greater growth rates, larger diel responses in stem diameter, and were less reactive to extended dry periods, than trees in areas of deep groundwater. These results were supported by isotope analysis that suggested all trees used groundwater when soil water stores were depleted at the end of the dry season, and this was most pronounced for trees with shallow groundwater. Trees may experience more frequent periods of water deficit stress and undergo reduced productivity in scenarios where water table accessibility is reduced, such as drawdown from groundwater pumping activities or periods of reduced rainfall recharge. The ability of trees to adapt to changing groundwater conditions may depend on the speed of change, the local hydrologic and soil conditions as well as the species involved. Our results suggest that E. camaldulesis growing at our study site is capable of utilizing groundwater even to depths {\textgreater}10 m, and stream perenniality is likely to be a useful indicator of riparian tree use of groundwater.},

@article{Salama1991,
abstract = {The traditional notion of defining the sustainable yield of an aquifer based on the average annual recharge rate or some derivative of the recharge component of the water balance is now obsolete. Groundwater technocrats are now aware that ecologically sustainable development of groundwater resources requires the identification of different users including the environment, the determination of the water requirements of each user, and securing the additional groundwater recharge or discharge which is essential to balance the legitimate use by one or more user. Alternatively, the provision of water at rates less than these requirements will mean a loss of environmental value or restricted human use. The Gnangara groundwater Mound located within the Perth Basin is a typical example of an area where a balance is actively being sought to meet the growing demand for groundwater by various users while securing water for the environment. The Gnangara Mound is a major source of water for market gardens, private and metropolitan water supply, as well as sustaining major pine plantations, native Banksia woodland and numerous wetlands and lakes. Due to increasing consumption by multiple users, water levels are declining at a constant rate. This is an indication that current groundwater discharge is being removed from aquifer storage and from reductions in the aquifer outflow component. It is anticipated that water levels will most likely continue to decline unless preventative measures are taken to increase the recharge or decrease groundwater ouflow to the ocean. The following measures are strongly advocated to abate and reverse current water level trends: (1) the removal of pine plantations to increase recharge; (2) the relocation of high volume abstraction to the discharge margins of the Gnangara Mound; and (3) the injection of wastewater in a line of wells parallel to the ocean west of the supply wells to reduce the outflow component and prevent seawater intrusion. Applying all these measures will only reduce the environmental impacts and not eliminate them, because the moment an aquifer is developed as a water source, even taking into consideration all the environmental water requirements, several ecologically sensitive areas will be affected. The delicate balance between the groundwater supply and demand by different users cannot be achieved without securing additional recharge for the utilised overdrawn parts of the aquifer or reducing groundwater discharge (aquifer outflow). Nevertheless, it is very difficult to achieve this balance, especially with changing weather patterns, increasing water demands and the relatively low infrastructure cost of groundwater abstraction that encourages further development to satisfy demand during drought periods.},

abstract = {Management of wetlands influenced by the Gnangara groundwater mound, Western Australia, is becoming increasingly challenging due to an ongoing decline in the regional groundwater table. A number of these groundwater-dependent wetlands have acidified (with adverse effects on the extant macroinvertebrate fauna) due to the oxidation of pyritic sediments. One management option in such cases is artificial augmentation of surface water in order to maintain or reinstate anaerobia in the sediments. This paper documents cycles of macroinvertebrate decline and recovery over 12 years of monitoring in three Gnangara mound wetlands affected by drought-induced acidification, one of which is being artificially augmented. Acidification did not result in a reduction of the total number of macroinvertebrate families present, however, there were clearly identifiable groups of acid-sensitive taxa (amphipods and isopods, ostracods, chydorid and daphnid cladocerans, mayflies, oligochaetes, clams and snails) and acid-tolerant taxa (sandfly larvae, macrothricid cladocerans and water boatmen). In the artificially augmented wetland, the effects of acidification were reversed: acid-sensitive taxa reappeared and acid-tolerant taxa decreased in numbers. Moreover, there were a number of taxa that appeared for the first time since augmentation, and summer family richness increased markedly. This study has shown that artificial augmentation of wetland water levels can be a successful recovery strategy for recently acidified systems, but this will depend on a number of factors, and the 'recovered' state will be at least slightly different from the original state. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Executive Summary This report sought to review existing sources of information for aquatic fauna on the Gnangara Mound in order to: • provide a synthesis of the richness, endemism, rarity and habitat specificity of aquatic invertebrates in wetlands; • identify gaps in aquatic invertebrate data on the Gnangara Mound; • provide a synthesis of the status of freshwater fishes on the Gnangara Mound; • assess the management options for the conservation of wetlands and wetland invertebrates. The compilation of aquatic invertebrate taxa recorded from wetlands on both the Gnangara Mound and Jandakot Mound) between 1977 and 2003, from 18 studies of 66 wetlands, has revealed a surprisingly high richness considering the comparatively small survey area and the degree of anthropogenic alteration of the plain. The total of over 550 taxa from 176 families or higher order taxonomic levels could be at least partially attributed to sampling effort. In addition, when compared to other regional surveys of wetland invertebrates, proportionate local and regional endemism appear relatively low for the survey area, and the proportion of rare taxa is also usually low. Overall it is proposed that levels of richness and endemism are attributable to geologically-recent colonizing forces associated with sea-level changes, dune formation and periods of aridity on the plain. Invertebrate colonization from multiple directions is possible: from the cooler southern, the warmer northern, and from the flowing and non-flowing wetlands on the adjacent Darling Scarp. Rare invertebrate taxa, on the other hand, appear to be associated with rare wetland types harbouring very specific (and perhaps unusual) microhabitats such as caves and tumulus springs. The work allows a re-evaluation of wetlands of importance on the Swan Coastal Plain. High priority wetlands with 'significant' invertebrate fauna in terms of aquatic invertebrate richness, endemism and/or rarity include:},

abstract = {Over the last 30 years declining rainfall and increased aquifer abstraction have heavily impacted water availability and ecosystems on the Gnangara Groundwater System (GGS). The mammal fauna of the area is considered to have been rich, with up to 28 terrestrial and 5 volant native species recorded since European settlement. This study investigated previous and current distribution of mammals on the GGS, and assessed potential impacts of predicted rainfall and groundwater declines on mammals. A general survey was conducted at 40 sites, and targeted trapping was undertaken for Hydromys chrysogaster and Isoodon obesulus fusciventer at wetlands. Nine native and seven introduced terrestrial mammal species were recorded during the general survey and capture rates were very low (1.05{\%}). The most commonly captured native species was Tarsipes rostratus. There is evidence that only 11 (9 recorded and 2 considered to be extant) of the 28 historically recorded terrestrial native mammals still persist in the area. The species predicted to be most susceptible to rainfall and groundwater level declines include H. chrysogaster, I. obesulus fusciventer, and T. rostratus. Management and recovery actions required to protect mammals under predicted climatic changes include identification and maintenance of refugia and ecological linkages, supplementation of lakes, development of ecologically appropriate fire regimes, and control of predators.

@article{Zencich2002,
abstract = {In Mediterranean ecosystems vegetation overlying shallow, transient aquifers is often dominated by woody phreatophytes, trees and shrubs that have been shown to be dependent on groundwater for their water requirements. Natural and anthropogenic alterations of groundwater tables (abstraction) are of clear importance to phreatophytic vegetation as reduction of water tables may sever these plants from their natural water sources. Seasonal water sources were determined for species growing on a coastal dune system that overlies a shallow sandy aquifer in south-western Australia. The plants studied grew over groundwater that ranged in depth from 2.5 to 30 m. The naturally occurring stable isotope of hydrogen (deuterium, $\delta$2H) was used to distinguish potential water sources. Isotopic ratios from vascular water of the dominant species of the study area (Banksia ilicifolia R. Br. and Banksia attenuata R. Br. trees) were compared with those of potential sources of precipitation, soil moisture and groundwater. A relatively shallow-rooted perennial shrub, Hibbertia hypericoides Benth., was also included as an isotopic reference. The results suggest that both B. attenuata and B. ilicifolia are phreatophytic as they derived some of their water from groundwater throughout the dry-wet cycle, with the exception of B. attenuata at the site of greatest depth to groundwater (30 m) which did not use groundwater. A high proportion ({\textgreater}50{\%}) of groundwater use was not maintained throughout all seasons. With the onset of the hot Mediterranean summer, progressive drying of the surface soils resulted in increased use of groundwater and deep soil moisture. During the wet winter plants used proportionately more water from the upper layers of the soil profile. The degree to which groundwater was utilised by the study species was dependent on the proximity of groundwater, availability of moisture in shallower horizons of the soil profile, root system distribution and maximum root depth.},
