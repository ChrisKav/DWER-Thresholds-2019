# Introduction

The Gnangara Groundwater System is located on the Swan Coastal Plain in south-western Australia. The system covers an area of 220 000 ha, extending from the Swan River in the south to the Moore River and Gingin Brook in the north and from the Darling Scarp in the east to the Indian Ocean in the west (Figure \ref{fig:Map}). The system consists of three major aquifers: the Superficial aquifer, Leederville aquifer and the Yarragadee aquifer. The Gnangara Mound is an expression of the Superficial aquifer, an unconfined aquifer composed of Quaternary-Tertiary sediments of the Swan Coastal Plan that is in direct connection with the lower Leederville aquifer at locations where the Osborne Formation has eroded [@Salama1991]. The underlying confined Leederville aquifer supplies Perth with up to 60 % of its drinking water supply. The Superficial aquifer consists mainly of sand, silt and clay sediments up to 100 m thick with different soils types distributed parallel to the coastline. These soils consist of Guildford Clay in the east, the Bassendean Dune System and Spearwood Dune Systems in the middle and the Quindalup Dune System along the west coast [@McArthur1960], with the distribution of vegetation and aquatic invertebrates largely determined by the underlying soil type, land form and depth to groundwater [@Heddle1980].

Recharge of the Gnangara Mound has been declining due to disruptions of water balances. Major users of groundwater in the Gnangara Mound include native vegetation, pine forest plantations, market gardens and wetlands [@Salama1991]. Clearing of native vegetation for pine plantations potentially reduces the recharge of groundwater as pines transpire more than the native plants they replace, as well as they directly access deeper levels of the water table. Agricultural abstraction of groundwater is also causing declines in water levels. Groundwater recharge has also been hampered by declining rainfall for the south west region of Australia; it is estimated that since the 1970's rainfall has been declining by approximately 12mm/year [@England2006], and since the mid 1990's, rainfall has generally been below the long term average (Figure \ref{fig:RainfallPlot} Left). The combined effects of groundwater abstraction, changes in vegetation and declining annual rainfall have contributed to long term declines in groundwater of the Gnangara Mound [@Yesertener2008].

The region experiences a Mediterranean-type climate with hot  dry summers and cooler wet winters. June to August represent the wettest months of the year and December to March usually have little rainfall (Figure \ref{fig:RainfallPlot} Right). Although declining rainfall has contributed to decreasing groundwater levels in the Gnangara Mound, abstraction of groundwater from private wells, market gardens, pine plantations and drinking water have cumulatively driven the decline. Nonetheless, up to 20 % less rainfall and 64 % less runoff occurred in the region between 1997 and 2003 compared to 1911 and 1974 [@Yesertener2008]. Drawdown of groundwater effects the mortality and health of plant communities that depend on groundwater access [@Groom2000; @Zencich2002; @Muler2018] and the composition of aquatic invertebrate communities that inhabit the surface waters of wetlands that frequent the Gnangara Mound [@Horwitz2008; @Horwitz2009].

## Scope of study

The Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) has environmental conditions set on its management of Gnangara groundwater resources, specified in Ministerial Statement 819 (published on 4 December 2009). Schedule 1 of Ministerial Statement 819 specifies minimum water level criteria or thresholds that the department must meet at staff gauges and/or monitoring bores at 14 wetlands and 16 bushland sites in the area covered by the Gnangara groundwater allocation plan, north of Perth (Figure \ref{fig:Map}). Due to groundwater declines caused by groundwater abstraction and declining rainfall, DWER has been unable to meet the criteria levels at approximately half of the sites in recent years. DWER is currently in the process of preparing a draft Gnangara groundwater allocation plan for public comment. Implementation of the plan will reduce public and private groundwater abstraction in the plan area by a total of up to 44 GL/yr in 2028. Even with these reductions in abstraction, modelling predicts the department will still not be able to achieve the current ‘absolute minimum’ levels at around half of the criteria sites and compliance rates will remain very similar to current rates because the expectations are for a continued drying climate regime into the future.

DWER are therefore proposing to alter the water level criteria at sites where the modelling projects absolute minimum levels will not be met in the future. The department has developed a new set of water level criteria (or minimum ‘thresholds’, in line with the Environmental Protection Authority’s recommended terminology (GET REFERENCE EPA 2018a)). The proposed minimum thresholds have been based on what groundwater modelling has indicated can likely be met at the respective criteria sites following reductions in groundwater abstraction, and (in some areas) planned land use changes. Reductions to groundwater abstraction will come into effect in 2028, while land use changes have started to occur in some areas already and will happen progressively over the plan period.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the proposed 2030 water level thresholds against the original listed site management objectives and values to determine:

+ what of the original stated objectives can/can’t be achieved and 
+ what values can/can’t be protected
    
The thresholds will not apply until 2030 because this is the end of the planning period for the new Gnangara plan, and after the 2028 reductions to abstraction have begun to have an effect on water levels.

A secondary objective is to review, and if necessary, suggest revisions to the new (proposed) management objectives to reflect what is achievable under the proposed changes to the minimum thresholds.

For some of the wetlands in the East Wanneroo area, planned urban development will increase recharge in the catchment zone, and reduced abstraction due to land use changes will also lessen drawdown impacts as current licences for irrigated agriculture are retired. Modelling projects that water levels in some of these wetlands (such as Lakes Mariginiup, Jandabup, Joondalup and Goollelal) could increase substantially. For example, water levels are projected to increase around 2 meters at Lake Joondalup, and between three and four meters in the vicinity of Lakes Jandabup and Mariginiup. These high water levels could also affect some of the existing values of the wetlands. Each of the wetlands listed have maximum water level criteria as stated in WAWA (1995), though due to the dry climate and ongoing declines in water levels, maximum levels have not been a focus to date, and are not part of the current implementation conditions in Statement 819. However, in light of the proposed land use changes and model projections, it is timely to review the validity of the original maximum water level criteria at these wetlands to support future decisions around groundwater management at and around these sites.

Therefore, a third objective is to consider the model projections for the four East Wanneroo wetlands identified and assess whether the WAWA (1995) maximum water level criteria are still valid (meet the proposed management objectives or whether a) an alternative value should be set, or b) further review is required to set a more appropriate maximum threshold).

Finally, a fourth objective of this study is to establish a minimum (and, if necessary a maximum) water level threshold at the staff gauge and bore for Lake Gwelup, based on maintaining the lake’s ecological and social values. Modelling projects that water levels will rise in the Lake Gwelup area by around 0.6 m.

## Structure of report

A detailed desktop review of all data collected during the *Gnangara Mound Environmental Monitoring Programme* and *Surveys of Gnangara Mound Wetland Vegetation Monitoring* will be presented in this report. An initial analysis of vegetation and aquatic assemblages is provided to understand the general trends of change for the Gnangara Mound system as a whole in terms of changes in diversity, loss/gain of taxa, homogenisation of communities and the impact of invasive species. This general assessment provides each wetland with a context of how historical shifts in diversity have shaped each wetland relative to other wetlands and the general changes being experienced by the Gnangara Mound as a whole.

To understand the shifts that have occurred in aquatic and vegetation communities and the role groundwater levels have had in driving ecological changes at each of the monitored sites, a detailed examination of each wetland is provided. For each wetland, a summary of historical groundwater/surface water levels and current water quality information is provided. Each wetland vegetation community has been modeled to understand the role of groundwater level on the abundance of plant species and a discussion is provided on the causes of historical and contemporary shifts in vegetation composition and the likely trajectory of change should the proposed threshold levels be adopted. A similar interpretation is provided for the aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. Considering the role of groundwater on vegetation structure and the historical shifts in aquatic assemblages, an assessment of the ecological consequences of the revised 2030 thresholds on the stated site values and site management objectives is provided for each wetland.

# Methodology

The surface geology of the Gnangara Mound is a reflection of processes that have shaped the Swan Coastal Plain over the last two million years due to changing sea levels. These processes determine the soils and sediments of the Swan Coastal Plain, which along with hydrological regimes, are important drivers of the ecology of each wetland. The Gnangara Mound, which is bordered by the 2.5 billion year old granite and gneiss of the Darling Scarp in the east, is composed of aeolian, lacustrine, fluvial and estuarine deposits that have created land forms which run parallel to the Scarp and coast. The sediments increase in age from the west coast to the Darling Scarp in the east. The Quindalup Dune System was formed 4,500 to 6,000 years ago (Holocene) and consists of calcareous sand dunes that trend north-south along the coast. Wetlands that occur in the Quindalup Dunes are usually non-groundwater dependent, such as estuaries, and therefore not covered by this report. The Spearwood Dune System is an aeolian calcareous dune system that is the surface expression of the Tamala Limestone formation formed in the Pleistocene. Wetlands are found in the swales of the dunes that run parallel to the coast and are usually elongated in shape. Some of the wetlands are permanently inundated and are deeper than elsewhere on the Gnangara Mound. The Bassendean Dune System is composed of highly permeable white siliceous sands deposited in the middle Pleistocene that are inter-dispersed with areas of poorly drained soils that are subjected to seasonal water logging. Bassendean wetlands typically vary on a theme of circular basin shapes. The wetlands found in each of these dunal systems are largely distinct from one another. For example, Bassendean wetlands generally have tannin rich and acidic waters, and Spearwood waters being clearer and alkaline. 

Twenty wetlands from the Bassendean and Spearwood Dune systems are analysed in this report to assess the ecological and managerial impacts of revised groundwater thresholds (Figure \ref{fig:Map}) and Table \ref{tab:WetMeta}).

## Vegetation monitoring

The overall objectives of the wetland vegetation monitoring on the Gnangara Mound are:

+ to determine the impact of altered groundwater regimes on the ecological condition of wetland vegetation
+ to monitor the condition and composition of fringing vegetation at selected Gnangara wetland sites, and to determine if observed changes to vegetation are associated with changes in groundwater and wetland water levels
+ to identify vegetation monitoring parameters relevant to monitoring objectives.

Vegetation is monitored every spring at selected wetland sites. Spring provides the best opportunity to capture the greatest plant diversity as well as enhancing identification as most Swan Coastal Plain flora are in flower. Annual surveys permit direct comparisons of vegetation changes to be made, especially in response to rapidly declining groundwaters.

Extensive methodological details can be found in the annual Wetland Vegetation Monitoring reports (see @Buller2019). The data analysed here primarily deals with the longitudinal cover abundance data set that has been compiled between 1996 and 2018. This data set has been collected by surveying the species present at established transects at each wetland. The standard design of these transects is a series of 3 to 4 10x10 m plots extending from the wetland end (Plot A) to the terrestrial end (generally Plot D). In some instances, when surface water declines are significant, the transect has been extended to include new plots at the current water edge. It is important to note that not every wetland is sampled every year, and some wetlands have gone a number of years since last survey (Figure \ref{fig:SurveyPeriod}). The vegetation at the wetland Pipidinny Swamp and four terrestrial sites, WM1, WM2, WM8 and Whiteman Park East, were surveyed for the first time this spring (2019). Only a brief description of those sites is given in this report and a more detailed analysis will be given in the 2020 Wetland Vegetation Report.

## Aquatic invertebrate monitoring

Data of aquatic macroinvertebrate communities have been compiled during the Gnangara Mound Environmental Monitoring Programme - Macroinvertebrate and Water Quality Wetland Monitoring since 1996 (see @Judd2019 for latest report and comprehensive methodology). The wetlands included in this report where macroinvertebrate data has been collected include Lake Jandabup, Lake Mariginiup, Loch McNess, Lake Nowergup, Lake Yonderup, Lake Goollelal, Lake Joondalup and Melaleuca Park 173. All of these wetlands are either permanently or ephemerally inundated. 

For each wetland, a series of habitat types are sampled using 250 $\mu$m mesh nets and identified under a microscope to family levels. An abundance score for each taxon is recorded (rare = 1-2 specimens, scarce = 3-10 specimens, common = 11-100 specimens, abundant = 100-1000 specimens and extremely abundant = > 1000 specimens). Sampled habitats are subject to availability, therefore not all habitats can be sampled each year for each wetland. Sampling occurs when spring high water levels are reached for each wetland each year to ensure maximum availability of habitats and potential diversity of macroinvertebrates. For the purposes of this report, sampled habitats for each wetland have been pooled for each year. Nonetheless, the disappearance of habitats when surface water levels are not high enough to make them available, or if habitats disappear due to loss of fringing vegetation, needs to be considered when considering the role of groundwater level on the aquatic ecology of these wetlands.

## Statistical analyses

Generalised additive models (GAMs) were used to model non-linear trends in water level time series data [@Wood2011]. Historical water level data for each of the wetlands in this report was accessed from the DWER website (http://www.water.wa.gov.au/maps-and-data/monitoring/water-information-reporting). To simplify modelling, mean monthly water levels were calculated and used for modelling. A cyclic cubic spline with 12 dimensions was used as a smooth term to ensure there was no discontinuity between January and December water levels. To account for correlated errors, an ARMA process, nested within each year, was fitted to the residuals using the R package *nlme* v 3.1-141 [@Pinheiro2019]. All GAMs were fitted using the R package *mgcv* v 1.8-30 [@Wood2019].

A multivariate analysis was used to explore the effects of ground/surface water level on vegetation communities. This fits a multivariate generalised linear model to the data so that the effects of species covariates (including groundwater level) on each species can be modeled [@Hui2016]. Species abundances (vegetation and macroinvertebrates) were fitted to negative binomial distributions and the models fitted with two latent variables. The models were fitted and unconstrained model-based ordinations were carried out on the macroinvertebrate and vegetation data using the *boral* package v 1.7 [@Hui2018]. The resulting ordinations enable graphical representations of communities for each wetland to be made, with points closer to each other more similar in terms of taxonomic composition than those more distant. Wetland specific boral models were run using the mean fitted water level for each survey year as a covariate in order to understand species specific interactions with water levels. All analyses were conducted using R (version 3.6.1)

# Trends throughout the Gnangara Mound

Each wetland monitored in the Gnangarra Mound vegetation surveys represent unique assemblages of native vegetation, particularly wetlands such as Melaleuca Park 173, Lake Jandabup and Loch McNess (Figure \ref{fig:AllOrd} left). Generally, the wetlands occurring in the Bassedean Dunes are distinct from those of the Spearwood Dunal System. However, annual monitoring reveals shifts in the composition of these assemblages, with evidence of some wetlands becoming increasingly similar to each other over time, probably in response to changing hydrological regimes. Lexia 186, Melaleuca Park 78 and Quin Brook appear to have vegetation communities with similar shifts in composition, suggesting the drying of these wetlands is a having a common influence on their vegetation structure. Similarly, Lake Mariginiup and Lake Wilgarup, both of which are now experiencing seasonal dry periods, are experiencing dramatic shifts in composition. It is likely that the temporary drying of these once permanent bodies of water is driving similar changes in vegetation composition. 

The aquatic invertebrate assemblages form three distinct groups based on the dunal system of the wetland (Figure \ref{fig:AllOrd} right). The Spearwood Dunes (Lake Goollelal, Lake Joondalup, Loch McNess, Lake Nowergup and Lake Yonderup) form the most diverse group, while the Bassendean Dunes Wetlands (Melaleuca Park 173) and East Wanneroo Interdunal Wetlands (Lake Jandabup and Lake Mariginiup) have different assemblages to each other. Generally, the Bassendean Dunes and East Wanneroo Interdunal Dunes wetlands are becoming more similar with each other, although such conclusions are based on a very limited set of wetlands. The Spearwood Dunes contain wetlands with two distinct trajectories, those migrating towards initial Lake Joondalup compositions (Loch McNess, Lake Goollelal and Lake Nowergup), and those migrating towards initial Loch McNess compositions (Lake Joondalup and Lake Yonderup). Nonetheless, each wetland has a distinct assemblage of macroinvertebrates but, aquatic macroinvertebrate communities have shifted during the monitoring period. Recent monitoring suggests that Loch McNess and Melaleuca Park 173  are becoming more similar to others wetlands. For instance, Loch McNess has shifted dramatically towards early Lake Joondalup composition. Lake Goollelal has displayed a similar, although not as dramatic, shift in composition. During the monitoring period, Melaleuca Park 173 is becoming increasingly similar to the assemblages at Lake Jandabup and Lake Mariginiup, which are also shifting towards Melaleuca Park 173. The communities at Lake Joondalup and Lake Yonderup have been shifting towards the early communities of Loch McNess. Lake Nowergup has shown some variation in community composition, but the current trajectory shows little change to the 1996 assemblage.

Most wetlands have lost families since the period 1996-2000, with the exception of Lake Goollelal and Loch McNess [@Judd2019]. The richness of the Lake Joondalup assemblage has not dramatically declined either. There are 11 families of aquatic macroinvertebrates that have not been recorded from the monitored wetlands in the past 5 years and seven families currently present that were not recorded in the initial 1996-2000 (excluding singletons; Table \ref{tab:ExtinctTab}). The richness of Acari (mites and ticks) has declined by 4 families while the Coleopteran Haliplidae and the Hemipteran Mesoveliidae are no absent from Lake Joondalup and Lake Yonderup. The Mollusc Sphaeriidae, probably a regionally endemic species [@Sommer2008], has been absent from Lake Nowergup since 1998, while Ancylidae has become abundant (possibly due to augmentation - see @Sommer2008). The insects, Corduliidae (Odonata), Ecnomidae (Trichoptera), Haliplidae (Coleoptera) and Mesoveliidae (Hemiptera) are all species with widespread distributions in the Swan Coastal Plain [@Sommer2008], but are now not found in the monitored wetlands reported here.

# Individual wetland descriptions

## Lake Goollelal

Lake Goollelal, located within the Yellagonga Regional Park, is recognised as an important waterbird habitat and drought refuge [@Froend2004] as well as habitat for the Swan River Goby (*Pseudogobius olorum*) and the Western Pygmy Perch (*Edelia vittata*; @Australia1995). The permanent deep waters found in the lake not only provides significant habitat for fauna and fringing vegetation, but also hold significant value as a place of public enjoyment. The lake is surrounded by a highly urbanised area, with the majority of the lake buffered by a belt of fringing vegetation although some residences are in close proximity to the lake's margin.

### Hydrology and water quality

Surface water levels recorded at Lake Goollelal reveal peak levels generally occur between September and November and lowest water levels between March and May (Table \ref{tab:GoollelalWater}). Annually, water levels have consistently varied by about 0.7 m during this period. Since 1995, there has been a general trend of decreasing surface water levels, although recent increases since 2016 show surface water at a similar depth to 1990 levels (Figure \ref{fig:GoollelalWaterPlot}). Surface water levels show similar trends to groundwater levels at a nearby bore (61611870) as the lake is largely fed by groundwater. Although the preferred minimum threshold of 26.0 mAHD has not been breached, it is likely the threshold is set too low as acidification of waters in the lake is a concern [@Quintero2018]. Proposed changes to the Ministerial Criteria include adopting a higher threshold level of 26.4 mAHD. Based on the modelling, the proposed threshold can be met at 2030.

Lake Goollelal has stable water quality [@Judd2019]. Water pH, normally around 7.5, has only been recorded below 7 in 2007 while the current risk of acidification remains low due to declining chloride:sulphate. Currently, the lake has low phosphorous, but is experiencing increasing levels of nitrogen, although levels are still below long-term averages.

### Vegetation dynamics

The composition of vegetation at Lake Goollelal has been assessed 15 times between 1997 and 2019 at four plots along an established transect. Plot A represents fringing *Melaleuca rhaphiophylla*/*Eucalyptus rudis* vegetation and a stable community of the native sedges, *Baumea articulata* and *Lepidosperma gladiatum*. The *M. rhaphiophylla*/*E. rudis* complex continues throughout the transect, which has also remained relatively stable in terms of cover abundance since 2002. There is a high richness of exotic vegetation species present at the lake. Generally, these exotic species have increased in abundance during the survey period (Figure \ref{fig:GoollelalStrat}).

Ordination reveals that Plot A has a distinct assemblage to the other plots but has displayed similar shifts in vegetation composition during the monitoring period (Figure \ref{fig:GoollelalOrd}). All plots show minor shifts in composition during the study period, with each plot be distinct from the others. Plot D displays a different pattern, probably due to the record of *B. articulata* in 1997 and the high cover abundance of exotic species. Bayesian regression analysis predicts many exotic species to increase in cover abundance with declining surface water levels (Figure \ref{fig:GoollelalPost}).

### Aquatic invertebrates

The mean family richness of aquatic invertebrates is 22 for Lake Goollelal (Figure \ref{fig:GoollelalRichInv}). Since 2008, family richness has mostly been stable and above the long term average. There are stable populations of Amphisopidae, Calanoida, Ceinidae, Chironominae, Corixidae, Cyprididae and Amphisopidae at the lake (Figure \ref{fig:GoollelalStratInv}). Other taxa are not currently recorded in the lake include Ceratopogonidae, Chydoridae, Oligochaeta and Pionidae. The absence of the Chydoridae (Cladocera) is notable given the abundance in early monitoring years. There was a major shift in the assemblage composition in 2006-2007, with ordination revealing two main groups of annual data; those collected pre 2007, and those collected post 2007 (Figure \ref{fig:GoollelalOrdInv}). However, recent high water levels and low nutrients appear to shifting the assemblages back towards pre-2007 compositions (see @Judd2019).

### Ramifications of revised thresholds

The proposed reductions in groundwater suggest that the current hydrological regime can be maintained. Adopting a minimum threshold of 26.4 mAHD (0.4 m higher than current threshold) will minimise the risk of acidification at Lake Goollelal. Under the 2030 scenario, vegetation composition is likely to remain distinct across the elevations of the basin, with *B. articulata* and *Lepidosperma gladiatum* persisting along the lake margin. The richness of exotic plant species in the higher areas of the basin are likely to persist or decline if surface water levels remain at, or greater than, present levels. Similarly, it is expected that the aquatic invertebrate community will remain stable as fringing vegetation preserves habitat availability and water quality.

Revised thresholds will likely maintain ecological conditions similar to present (Table \ref{tab:GoollelalCompliance}). The most important impact of the revised thresholds is that it will ensure water levels remain at, or higher than, present levels which has positive implications for habitat availability and risk of acidification. The sustenance of permanent water will ensure that Lake Goollelal acts as a drought refuge for waterbirds, with seasonal fluctuations in water levels ensuring feeding habitats are available for waders during the summer months. The preservation of fringing vegetation, submerged macrophytes and deep water will also ensure the wetland continues to support important native fish species (*P. olorum* and *E. vittata*), a feature becoming rarer among wetlands in the Swan Coastal Plain. Conservation of these values will maintain the site as a place for public enjoyment and maintain the current landscape amenity values.

## Loch McNess

Loch McNess, located in Yanchep National Park, is a relatively undisturbed wetland with large areas of intact Herdsman Complex vegetation. The lake has had relatively good water quality and provides an important habitat for water birds and other aquatic fauna [@Froend2004]. Permanent water is required to support a local Rakali (*Hydromys chrysogaster*) population as well as both resident and visiting populations of waterbirds and waders. The southern lake at Loch McNess is one of the few wetlands known to contain the nightfish *Bostokia porosa* and has one of the most rich aquatic macroinvertebrate communities of the Swan Coastal Plain. Loch McNess is a wetland of high conservation value because of its intact vegetation, largely unaltered aquatic processes and important populations of fauna [@Froend2004].

### Hydrology and water quality

Since early 2011, readings for the staff gauge (6162564) at Loch McNess have frequently been below the gauge's limit. It is therefore likely the decline in surface water levels have continued pasted the levels shown in Figure \ref{fig:McNessWaterPlot}. Nonetheless, surface water, which were remarkably stable before 2003 at 7 mAHD, have declined at least 1.5 m to present levels. These declines have been mirrored in surrounding bores (Figure \ref{fig:McNessWaterPlot}). Mean maximum and minimum seasonal water levels have decline by 0.9 m since 1994-2004 levels (Table \ref{tab:LochMcNessWater}). Changes in seasonal patterns are difficult to interpret due to staff gauge 6162564 being mostly dry since 2014, but during the period 2009-2014, minimum water levels were not being reached until May, compared to March in the decade 1994-2004. A recent increase in water level, as seen in surrounding wetlands during the last few seasons, has not been observed at Loch McNess. The dramatic decline in water levels is causing the terrestrialisation of the lake as much of the lake bed is now undergoing recruitment by fringing vegetation.

The lake has been non-compliant with ministerial water levels since 2003 and water levels are now approximately 1.0 m below this threshold. Modelling of groundwater levels under proposed abstraction reductions will not provide sufficient increases in groundwater to make this wetland compliant with existing thresholds. Under the new plan, a proposed threshold of 8.0 mAHD at bore 61612104 will satisfy the proposed threshold of surface waters in the lake at 6.2 mAHD (0.75 m below existing threshold).

Water quality at Loch McNess appears to have stabilised in the past couple of years. Normal pH is thought to be over 8.0 but has been below 8.0 since 2010. Current monitoring suggests a pH of 7.8, the highest since 2010 [@Judd2019]. Chloride:sulphate and alkalinity observations suggest that acidification is not a concern at the wetland. There has been a trend of increasing nitrogen levels in the wetland since 2010, but this trend has not continued for 2017-2018 despite current levels being double 1997-2007 levels. Current phosphate levels are an order of magnitude greater than 1999-2004 levels and require close monitoring.

### Vegetation dynamics

A vegetation monitoring transect was established in 2004 with three plots (A, B, and C) plus an additional up-slope plot in 2009 (Plot D) and a plot down-slope of Plot A in 2010 (Plot E; Figure \ref{fig:McNessStrat}). The fringing vegetation is largely comprised of a *Melaleuca rhaphiophylla*/*Eucalyptus rudis* complex. Most trees are in average to good health [@Buller2019]. *Baumea juncea* is found in Plots A - D at relatively constant cover abundances. *Baumea articulata*, however, disappeared from Plot A in 2005 and was present in the new down-slope plot (Plot E) until 2014. Currently, *B. articulata* is probably not present at the site (Buller 2019 - personal observation) and the disappearance is likely due to a combination of a fire in 2009 and declining water.

Plots A and B have shifted in community composition dramatically during the monitoring period as the vegetation responds to lower surface water levels in the lake and the impact of fire in 2004 and 2009 (@Buller2019; Figure \ref{fig:McNessOrd}). Regressional analysis reveals that the exotic *Avena barbata* and the native *Tricoryne elatior* will increase the most in cover abundance as water levels in the lake remain low or decline further (Figure \ref{fig:McNessPost}). The natives, *Carex fascicularis*, *Triglochin centrocarpa* and *M. rhaphiophylla* are most likely to decline dramatically at the wetland under a scenario of continued low water levels.

### Aquatic macroinvertebrates

Loch McNess is the most taxonomically rich of the Spearwood Dune wetlands, with about 27 macroinvertebrate families regularly found there (Figure \ref{fig:McNessRichInv}). However, the composition of the community is shifting (Figure \ref{fig:McNessOrdInv}). The communities were relatively stable in terms of composition until 2008 when water levels began to decline significantly (Figure \ref{fig:McNessWaterPlot}). The current trajectory suggests the dissimilarity between pre-2008 and contemporary communities will continue. The site is now dominated by common taxa of the Swan Coastal Plain such as Amphisopidae, Chironomidae larvae, Corixidae, Culicidae larvae, Cyclopoida (*Daphnia*), Dytiscidae, Notonectidae and Pionidae (Figure \ref{fig:McNessStratInv}). Some of these, namely Chironomidae and Culicidae larvae, are considered nuisance species. The Amphipod, Ceinidae, has not been collected in the lake since 2014 and the shrimp *Palamonetes australis* not recorded since 2010. This shift in macroinvertebrate assemblage indicates serious changes in ecological processes as the wetland transitions towards a nutrient enriched shallow lake.

### Ramifications of revised thresholds

Managing the lake at the proposed threshold (0.75 m below the current threshold) will continue the deterioration of site values at Loch McNess (Table \ref{tab:McNessCompliance}). Extraterrestrial of large areas of once inundated lake bed will continue, nutrient levels may stay elevated and important habitats for Rakali may be lost. The characteristic stable water levels have been severely disrupted by a changing hydrological regime, and the proposed threshold will not manage surface water at a sufficient level to return to this state. Altered ecological processes have caused shifts in nutrient levels and the composition of macroinvertebrate assemblages. Again, these features of Loch McNess are unlikely to return to normal given the proposed lowering of threshold levels.

## Lake Yonderup

Located to the south of Loch McNess and north of Lake Wilgarup in Yanchep National Park, Lake Yonderup has a high conservation value as it represents a largely undisturbed wetland with high macroinvertebrate richness and excellent water quality. The permanently filled lake is dependent on groundwater to maintain habitats and biophysical processes [@Froend2004a]. Like other lakes in the region, Lake Yonderup has experienced a consistent decline in surface water levels that has affected the condition and health of fringing vegetation and aquatic processes. A fire also effected the fringing vegetation in 2004/2005 [@Rogan2006].

### Hydrology and water quality

There has been a continual decline in surface water levels at staff gauge 6162565 since 1994. Prior to 1994, water levels were relatively stable at 6 mAHD but have since declined to approximately 5.3 mAHD (Figure \ref{fig:YoderupWaterPlot}). There has been no increase in surface water levels with recent high rainfall seasons. Mean maximum and minimum seasonal water levels have only declined 0.2 and 0.3 m, respectively from 1994-1999 levels (Table \ref{tab:YonderupWater}). There has been nearly a four fold increase in seasonal water level variation and waters are generally now in decline for more than 200 days a year. The bore 61611840 is located near the vegetation transects and represents the groundwater levels in the superficial aquifer that the vegetation at the transect is utilising. There has been a similar decline in groundwater levels at this bore until 2017, although observations have only been recorded since 2008. Therefore surface water levels are used to assess changes in vegetation as surface water is likely an expression of the superficial aquifer and show similar trends [@Froend2004]. The current ministerial minimum threshold is 5.9 mAHD while the 2030 proposed threshold is 5.7 mAHD. The lake has been non-complaint with the current threshold since about 2004. Slight increases in surface water levels are required to meet the proposed threshold.

Lake Yonderup has the lowest nutrient levels of all the monitored wetlands on the Gnangara Mound [@Judd2019], however, the most recent observations for 2018 indicate that total nitrogen levels may be increasing. Otherwise, the water chemistry of the lake has remained relatively stable. Stable alkalinity and a pH that consistently remains above 7.0 suggests there is little risk of acidification.

### Vegetation dynamics

The vegetation transect, established in 1997, is located 750 m south of the basin and is therefore not representative of vegetation at the wetland itself. The lake provides habitat for *Baumea articulata* although there is recent evidence of *Typha orientalis* invading the wetland [@Judd2019]. At the vegetation monitoring transects, the site was reported to have a rich exotic community before monitoring began in 1997 and this characteristic of the site has persisted. Currently, exotics account for 60% of the cover abundance and native richness has been declining (@Buller2019; Figure \ref{fig:YonderupStrat}). The shifts in vegetation composition at each plot suggest vegetation has changed dramatically since 1997 but largely stabilised in the late 2000's (Figure \ref{fig:YonderupOrd}). There was a dramatic shift in vegetation composition after the 2004/2005 fire which also coincided with an increase in the rate of decline of surface waters. All the native species, including *Banksia attenuatta* and *Melaleuca preissiana*, are likely to decline in cover abundance under a scenario of sustain low water levels or further declining groundwaters (Figure \ref{fig:YonderupPost}). In fact, *B. attenuatta* and *M. preissiana* have already disappeared from the monitoring transect, while stands of *Melaleuca rhaphiophylla* are unhealthy.

### Aquatic macroinvertebrate community

Taxonomic richness of the macroinvertebrate assemblage in Lake Yonderup has been declining since 2012 (Figure \ref{fig:YonderupRichInv}). Richness is now lower than previous records and the trend may suggests some shifts in ecological processes due to declining water levels. The composition of the Lake Yonderup macroinvertebrate community is variable (Figure \ref{fig:YonderupOrdInv}). Many taxa are not recorded every year, or are absent for periods, such as Ceinidae, Oligochaeta and Orthocladiinae. Other taxa have declined, or perhaps become locally extinct, including Dytiscidae and Hydrophilidae (Figure \ref{fig:YonderupStratInv}). Chironominae, Cyclopoida, Cyprididae and Leptoceridae have been recorded in nearly every sampling event at Lake Yonderup.

### Ramifications of revised thresholds

Managing the lake at the proposed 2030 thresholds may alleviate some of the effects of declining surface waters at Lake Yonderup (Table \ref{tab:YonderupCompliance}). Higher water levels may improve the cover abundances of many native plant species, however it is unknown whether the proposed increases in surface water are sufficient to achieve this. Like Loch McNess, the remarkably stable surface water levels were a feature of this wetland, and have now been compromised by declining water levels and increased seasonal variation. As no vegetation transects exists at the lake's margin, it can only be speculated that without any effort to reduce the seasonal variation in surface water levels to the small fluctuations characteristic of the lake before 2004, fringing vegetation will be dominated by sedges capable of surviving periods without surface water. Combined with stable surface waters higher than present, and the continuation of stable water quality, it is also likely that sustaining water levels at the proposed threshold will halt the decline in macroinvertebrate richness of the lake as habitats currently unavailable to aquatic invertebrates become available again.

## Lake Joondalup

At 611.5 ha, Lake Joondalup is the largest monitored wetland and is managed by the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.  The lake is an important habitat and drought refuge for water birds, and in conjunction with Lake Goollelal, is managed to support the full range of avian habitats [@Australia1995]. Other management objectives include the conservation of diverse wetland vegetation communities, including sedge beds, fringing woodlands and aquatic macrophytes, and the maintenance or enhancement of aquatic fauna in the lake. Lake Joondalup supports an important population of Pygmy Perch (*Edelia vittata*) and Swan River Goby (*Pseudogobius olorum*) and the fringing woodlands and bushland support a variety of significant mammal species.

### Hydrology and water quality

Lake Joondalup has remained permanently inundated at the staff gauge since 1986 [@Horwitz2009]. However, vast regions of the basin dry most summers and provide habitat for visiting water birds.  Recent monitoring of surface water levels at the staff gauge 6162572 remained relatively stable from 2002 but have been increasing from 16.4 mAHD to approximately 17.2 mAHD in 2019 (Figure \ref{fig:JoondalupWaterPlot}). Five-year summaries of hydrological regimes at Lake Joondalup also reveal the higher mean minimum and maximum surface water levels in the latest period compared to earlier periods, as well as an increase in the number of days to reach seasonal minimum water levels (Table \ref{tab:JoondalupWater}). Historically, groundwater levels at monitoring bore 61610661 declined significantly by 1.2 m from 1970 to 2002. Currently, groundwater levels at this bore, as well as bore 61611423 (likely to better reflect lake surface water variation), have been increasing since 2015 to levels similar to the early 1990s.

Recent monitoring suggests pH has been increasing from 6.8 in 2016 up to 8.4 in 2018, probably attributable the higher water levels [@Judd2019]. The lake often has the lowest levels of acidity and highest alkalinity of all the monitored wetlands. Total nitrogen and phosphorus levels have been high in Lake Joondalup, which is now typical of Spearwood dune lakes in modified urban landscapes.

### Vegetation Dynamics

Vegetation surveys have been conducted along a northern (Figure \ref{fig:JoondalupNthStrat}) and southern (Figure \ref{fig:JoondalupSthStrat}) transect at Lake Joondalup since 1996 and were last surveyed in 2015. *Melaleuca raphiophylla* dominates the overstorey of plots in the northern transect while exotic species are abundant in the understory vegetation. There has been an increasing trend in cover abundance of the exotics *Bromus diandrus*, *Ehrharta longiflora*, *Euphorbia terracina*, *Fumaria muralis* and *Peargonium capitatum* in recent years. Fires in 2003 reduced the canopy condition and abundance of *M. raphiophylla* in the southern transect, and despite the slightly higher cover abundance of native species, native and exotic species richness is equal along the transect. The site also contains healthy stands of *Baumea articulate* in the submerged regions of the transect.

All plots in both transects have displayed similar trends in community compositional change during the survey periods (Figure \ref{fig:JoondalupOrd}). In the southern transect, ordination reveals separation of the plots along the first axis, with a general temporal trend along the second axis, except for a period around 2003 - 2006 where there was a hiatus. This hiatus may be associated with the 2003 bushfire and represents a recovery period where species composition changed little. The trajectory for plot A is different, however, as the trend away from the original 1996 survey has reversed and the contemporary community is now becoming more like the 1996 communities. Similar patterns have been observed in the northern transect despite the transect not being impacted by the 2003 fire event. A number of native species are likely to increase in cover abundance at the transects if water levels remain at present levels or increase further, including *Baumea articulata* (Figure \ref{fig:JoondalupPost}). Other natives are likely to decline in cover abundance under a similar scenario of high water levels, including a number of *Acacia saligna*, *Banksia menziesii* and *Banksia prionotes*.

### Aquatic Invertebrates

Aquatic invertebrates have been sampled from Lake Joondalup every year since 1996. During this period, 16-30 families of aquatic invertebrates have been recorded per sampling event, except for the latest round in 2018 where family richness was only nine (Figure \ref{fig:JoondalupRichInv}). This exceptionally low family richness was likely due to the lack of insects and associated parasitic mites among the sampled communities. The phreatoicid isopod *Amphisopus palustris* was also absent in 2018 despite being collected every spring in Lake Joondalup (except 2004 ; Figure \ref{fig:JoondalupStratInv}). Furthermore, this reduced richness occurred during a period of relatively high surface water levels, suggesting other anthropogenic factors may be responsible for the decline of insect fauna within the lake. Otherwise, the lake hosts abundant populations of Ceinidae (amphipods), *Palaemonetes australis* (crustacean), *Calanoid copepods* and Cyprididae (ostracods). There is high variation in the composition of annual macroinvertebrate community composition making it difficult to interpret a trajectory of compositional change (Figure \ref{fig:JoondalupOrdInv}). There has been a general trend of community composition shifting away from the initial 1996 community.

### Ramifications of revised thresholds

The water levels in the vicinity of Lake Joondalup are expected to increase up to 2.1 m by 2030 from 2013 levels based on the revised groundwater allocations. This increase in water level will continue the increasing trend being observed in the lake's surface water levels since 2015. Maintaining surface water levels above 16.2 mAHD at staff 6162572 will ensure permanent water habitat for fauna and flora and the visual amenity of the area (Table \ref{tab:JoondalupCompliance}). The diverse macrophytes inhabiting plot A and B of both transects are likely to persist and continue to provide a rich habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Although important native macrophytes and wetland species are likely to continue at relatively high cover abundances under the future scenario, there are some native species that are likely to decrease in cover abundance or disappear. This group mainly includes *Acacia* and *Banksia* species which provide important habitat for fauna up-slope of the lake. Further vegetation monitoring is required at these transects to determine vegetation compositional changes since 2015 to understand if the trajectory in compositional change is continuing.

## Lake Mariginiup

Lake Mariginiup has a high conservation value as a groundwater dependent wetland [@Froend2004]. There are a number of wader birds present at the lake that require the shallow water during the summer for feeding, however, high water levels are required in winter to prevent vegetation encroachment into these habitats. The dramatic decline in surface and groundwaters has likely diminished this important component of the system. Sediment processes have been altered as soils dry and water quality is deteriorating due to acidification [@Judd2019].

### Hydrology and water quality

Since 1997, Lake Mariginiup has frequently dried or been dry at the staff gauge 6162577 during the summer. Interpretations of seasonal patterns therefore need to be made with caution and perhaps it is more reliable to use groundwater levels at the nearby bore 616100685 as a proxy (Figure \ref{fig:MariginiupWaterPlot}). Nonetheless, mean season maximum water levels have declined from 42.0 m to 41.4 m since the 1994-1999 period (Table \ref{tab:MariginiupWater}). Maximum water levels usually occur in September/October. There has been a recent increase in groundwater level since 2015 which has caused maximum spring surface levels to increase. Proposed changes in 2030 abstraction are projected to increase surface water levels by 3.9 m and meet a threshold level of 42.1 mAHD. This will increase surface waters to levels higher than has been recorded during the monitoring program.

Acidification has effected the water quality at Lake Mariginiup. Since 2005, the pH of the surface water has consistently been below 4.0 with only 2018 levels slightly higher (4.3; @Judd2019). Alkalinity is below 1 mg/L suggesting that the lake has lost its capacity to buffer changes in pH. Recent changes in acidification are likely due to the rises in surface waters since 2015 that has helped reduce the sulphate concentrations. Ammonia and total nitrogen levels of Lake Mariginiup are the highest of any lake monitored on the Swan Coastal Plain. Recent total phosphorous levels have doubled and make Lake Mariginiup one of the highest phosphorous wetlands.

### Vegetation dynamics

Vegetation composition and shifts in composition are similar along the length of the transect at Lake Mariginiup which was established in 1996 (Figure \ref{fig:MariginiupStrat}). *Baumea articulata* was present at high cover abundance throughout the transect until the early 2000's, but has since disappeared from the transect as surface water levels declined (*B. articulata* still occurs in other regions of the wetland). *Eucalyptus rudis* has declined in the lower parts of the plots and *Melaleuca rhaphiophyla* is no longer present in the transect. There has been a general increase in the cover abundances of exotics throughout the monitoring period. There was a shift in community composition at all three plots around 2005 which was driven by increases in *Exocarpus sparteus* and *Jacksonia furcellata* and some exotics, such as *Ehrharta calycina*, *Ehrhatah longiflora*, *Lotus suaveolens* and *Ursinnia anthemoides*.

Regression analysis reveals a number of native species that will increase in cover abundance with increasing surface water levels (Figure \ref{fig:MariginiupPost}). Species likely to increase in cover abundance include *Angianthus* sp., *Epilobium billardierianum*, *Isolepis cernua*, *Juncus* sp., *Lepyrodia muirii*, *Lobelia alata* and *Villarsia capitata*. Other natives, including *Acacia cyclops*, *Acacia saligna* and *E. sparteus*, are likely to decrease in cover abundance as water levels increase.

### Aquatic invertebrates

Lake Mariginiup has been sampled every year between 1996 and 2002, 2004 and 2009, 2012 and 2018, making it difficult to interpret trends in community change. Despite the acidification that has occurred in the lake, there is a remarkably high richness of invertebrates (Figure \ref{fig:MariginiupRichInv}) and seems to be a recovery since the 2012 sampling event where family richness was 13. Nonetheless, richness has been below average for the site since 2005 when acidification processes began affecting the lake. Recent increases in water levels may be promoting higher richness by increasing habitat availability and diversity. There has been a dramatic shift in macroinvertebrate community compositions between 2002 and 2004 (Figure \ref{fig:MariginiupOrdInv}). Recent data suggests the community may be returning to pre-2004 composition, which again may be attributable to increased surface waters and habitat availability. Some families have disappeared from the lake, including Amphisopidae, Ceinidae, Chydoridae and Cyprididae (Figure \ref{fig:MariginiupStratInv}).

### Ramifications of revised thresholds

As a result of land use change and reductions in local abstraction, water levels are expected to rise beyond 2028. Adopting a preferred minimum peak threshold of 42.1 mAHD will require water levels to rise hgiher than what has been recorded since 1980 in order to be compliant. Thus it is difficult to predict the ecological consequences as the lake has never been monitored at those levels (Table \ref{tab:MariginiupCompliance}). It is unlikely that large areas of the wetland will continue to dry during summer under the proposed 2030 scenario. The greater innundation of Lake Mariginiup will likely allieviete acidification issues as sediment are re-wetted and sediment processes return to normal. Artificial augmentation of surface waters at Lake Jandabup have shown that returning a wetland to a 'more' normal hydrological regime can reverse the effects of acidification, although this process is dependent on a number of factors, including  whether the sufficient buffering capacity of the sediments remain [@Sommer2009].

## Lake Jandabup

Lake Jandabup is an artificially watered wetland that supports the most diverse sedge and macrophyte vegetation communities in the Bassendean Dune wetlands [@Judd2019]. Lake Jandabup has a high conservation value as it is one of the few 'eastern circular wetlands' to not be be permanently acidic. Low rainfall and groundwater abstraction impacts are thought to have caused an acidification event in 1998 and 1999 but restoration of water levels by artificial augmentation has returned the pH to normal levels [@Judd2019]. The waters usually have low levels of nutrients and clear waters that supports a diverse aquatic invertebrate community. The current trajectory of the macroinvertebrate community suggests the assemblage is transitioning towards a state that will be similar to the communities of Lake Mariginiup and Melaleuca Park 173. All of these wetlands have waters with pH <7 suggesting acidification is having a significant influence on the composition of these communities. The abundance of invertebrates and fringing vegetation habitats also allow the wetland to support high numbers of resident and visiting water birds [@Bamford2003].

### Hydrology and water quality

Surface water levels of Lake Jandabup have only declined slightly since 1980 (Figure \ref{fig:JandabupWaterPlot}). Mean maximum seasonal water levels are now 0.2 m lower than in 1994-1999 but mean minimum seasonal water levels are 0.1 m higher than 1994-1999 levels and since 2009, the period of annual maximum to minimum water levels has increased (Table \ref{tab:JandabupWater}). Projected ground water levels in the vicinity of this wetland are predicted to increase by 3.4 m in 2030 due to proposed changes in abstraction and proposed changes to the ministerial criteria suggest adopting the current absolute minimum peak of 44.3 mAHD. It is unlikely surface waters will need to be sustained artificially and that an increased threshold level can be proposed.

The pH of Lake Jandabup has not exceeded 7.0 since 2011 and is currently between 6.1 and 6.6. Low water levels expose sediments at Lake Jandabup, making it susceptible to acidification. Alkalinity is currently very low, suggesting that the lake may be loosing its capacity to buffer pH changes. Deterioration of the chloride:sulphate ratio is also concerning. Maintaining high water levels may be essential to preventing the drying of sediments around the lake margin and subsequent acidification of this wetland. Typically, Lake Jandabup is a low nutrient wetland, however current total nitrogen and phosphorus levels are currently the highest recorded for the monitoring period.

### Vegetation dynamics

The Lake Jandabup wetland consists of a diverse community of native vegetation. In the 2017-2018 season, 43 native species were recorded with only 14% of the total cover abundance belonging to exotic species [@Buller2019]. There are four overstorey species present at the wetland, including *Banksia attenuata*, *Banksia ilicifolia*, *Banksia menziesii*, *Eucalyptus rudis* and *Maleleuca preissiana* (Figure \ref{fig:JandabupStrat}), all of which have been increasing in health. A dense understorey of *A. scoparia*, *B. elegans* and *H. angustifolium* exists at the lower elevated plots A and B. There has been a continual shift in community composition of Lake Jandabup throughout the monitoring period that reflects changes in invasive species cover abundances (Figure \ref{fig:JandabupOrd}). A number of species are predicted to increase in cover abundance with increasing water levels, particularly *Euchilopsis linearis* which is currently present in the lower parts of the basin (Figure \ref{fig:JandabupPost}). 

### Aquatic invertebrates

Family richness of aquatic macroinvertebrates in Lake Jandabup is distinct and higher than other monitored sites because of the relatively high degree of habitat diversity. However, the family richness of the lake has been below average for the lake since 2016 (Figure \ref{fig:JandabupRichInv}). There has been a recent shift in community composition away from the 1996 community, suggesting that the community may continue to shift away from what has typically been recorded in the lake in future years as water quality and hydrological changes alter ecosystem processes (Figure \ref{fig:JandabupOrdInv}). The highly variable communities between 1996-2006 may be in response to acidification events. Ceinidae, Calanoida, Daphniidae and Notonectidae are usually present in the lake at high abundance (Figure \ref{fig:JandabupStratInv}).

### Revised water level threshold effects

Many of the site values of Lake Jandabup are likely to be maintained under the proposed changes to groundwater abstraction (Table \ref{tab:JandabupCompliance}). Maintaing surface water levels at the current levels will minmise the risk of further acidification by ensuring sediments remain wet. It is predicted here that many native vegetation species are likely to increase in cover abundance given higher water levels. If water levels raise to the point were artificial augmentation is no longer required, restortion of the hydrological regime may facilitate the expansion of wader habitat as seasonal variation in surface water levels increases towards 0.8 m. The current low pH of the wetland is driving the aquatic macroinvertebrate community away from pre-2000 compositions and towards an composed of a less diverse, acidiphile community that is likely to also occure at Lake Mariginiup and Melaleuca Park 173. Careful monitoring of nutrient levels is required also as increased nitrogen levels may also be driving the shift in this aquatic community.

## Lake Nowergup

Lake Nowergup is one of the deepest permanent lakes on the Swan Coastal Plain and provides a permanent habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish, as well as an important drought refuge for water birds [@Froend2004]. Despite the wetlands being artificially maintained since 1989, water levels have continued to decline. This decline has altered the fringing vegetation of the lake and reduced the area of permanent water.

### Hydrology and water quality

Since 2010, surface water levels in the lake have decline significantly to levels that are currently below the minimum reading on the staff gauge 6162567 (Figure \ref{fig:NowergupWaterPlot}). Groundwater levels at the nearby bore 61611247 have shown similar trends as surface water levels. Between 2008 and 2014, groundwater levels at the bore have declined by more than 1.0 m. A similar decline in surface waters is likely and measurements from this bore have been used in the vegetation analysis. Currently, groundwater levels have increased to above 15 mAHD due to recent rainfall. Mean seasonal maximum groundwater levels from the 1994-1999 period to the 2014-2019 period declined by 1.7 m, while for the mean minimum water levels the decline was 1.5 m (Table \ref{tab:NowergupWater}). Maximum  and minimum water levels now tend to occur earlier in the year than previously. Proposed threshold levels will apply to bore 61610601, where under proposed reduction in abstraction a threshold at 18.0 mAHD should be achievable. This is likely to correspond to threshold level of 16.0 mAHD at the staff gauge, 0.8 m lower than the current threshold.

Water quality in Lake Nowergup is remarkably stable given the declines in surface waters and associated groundwaters [@Judd2019]. Acidity is usually low and alkalinity high, indicating that the lake has sufficient capacity to buffer against acidification. A pH above 9 is not unusual for this system. Recent monitoring suggests the lake currently has high nutrient levels, with current total nitrogen and total phosphorus at record high concentrations for the lake, and among the highest for all Spearwood Dune wetlands. Current nitrogen levels are twice the long-term mean levels. Livestock has recently been able to access the lake bed and may be the cause of elevated nutrients.

### Vegetation Dynamics

There are two vegetation monitoring transects at Lake Nowergup, one in the northern part of the lake and one in the southern part. Both transects were established in 1996 and the northern one was last surveyed in 2016 while the southern one was last surveyed in 2018. In 2001, the original plots were realigned to better encompass wetland vegetation near the lake. Therefore, only post 2001 data is analysed here. In both transects, there has been a recent shift in vegetation composition of the down-slope plots (A and B) transitioning towards the higher, more terrestrial plots (C and D; Figure \ref{fig:NowergupOrd}). This shift has been driven by declines of *B. articulata* and *M. rhaphiophyla* and the increase of *E. rudis* (Figure \ref{fig:NowergupNthStrat} and \ref{fig:NowergupSthStrat}). Further declines in water level are likely to decrease the abundance of fringing vegetation *B. articulata* and *Typha orientalis*. Other native species, including *E. rudis*, *Lepidosperma longitudinale* and *Rhagodia baccata* are likely to increase in abundance (Figure \ref{fig:NowergupPost}), particularly at lower elevations of the basin.

### Macroinvertebrates Dynamic

Aquatic invertebrate richness has been below average for Lake Nowergup since 2010, with 19 families detected for the last three sampling occasions (Figure \ref{fig:NowergupRichInv}). There is currently a trend of declining richness since 2008. This decline in richness is likely due to the loss of fringing macrophytes due to declining water levels and submerged macrophytes in the center of the lake which have also disappeared (GMEMP 2018). Loss of macrophytic habitat has coincided with elevated nutrient levels which would have also altered ecological processes and invertebrate assemblages. Ordination reveals a marked change in assemblage composition from 1996 to 2018 (Figure \ref{fig:NowergupOrdInv}). Communities appeared to shifted most dramatically from 2002 to 2006 which coincides with supplementation of surface waters by artificial watering. The current shift away from the 1996 community may be driven by the high nutrients being experienced at the lake. Changes can be associated to loss of Ceinidae, Amphisopidae, Notodromadidae and Chydoridae (Figure \ref{fig:NowergupStratInv}). As stated by Judd [-@Judd2019] "*The macroinvertebrate monitoring undertaken in 2018 confirms the trends of reduced richness and changing assemblages. The artificial maintenance regime at this wetland was clearly inadequate to maintain ecological integrity and has failed to prevent a loss of habitats, the consequence of lowered water levels. The resulting change in invertebrate assemblages may well be irreversible and steps to restore more representative assemblages must involve more than maintenance of minimum water levels.*"

### Ramifications of revised thresholds

Many of the site values of Lake Nowergup are unlikely to be maintained under the proposed changes to groundwater abstraction (Table \ref{tab:NowergupCompliance}). Declining water levels have, and will continue to, cause a significant decline in macroinvertebrate richness and shift in assembalge composition away from what was once typical of this wetland. This deterioration of the macroinvertebrate community is probably driven by a decline in habitatm availablity for these organisms, although increased nutrient levels may also be faciliting this process. Although many native vegetation species are predicted to increase in cover abundance with declining water levels, there is a substantial decline in fringing wetland vegetation an sedges. This continued terrestrialisation of the vegetation community will further impact the macroinvertebrate communities as many of these species (eg. *B. articulata*) provide important habitat for many macroinvertebrate species and reduce the effect of nutrient enrichment.

## Lake Wilgarup

Lake Wilgarup is a high conservation, seasonally inundated dampland located in the southern area of Yanchep National Park. The basin covers an area of 16 ha in a limestone depression that experiences discharge from rising groundwaters. There are extensive peat deposits in the lake bed that suggest the sediments have been saturated for a long period. Surface waters have not been recorded in the basin since 1998 and peats are now dry and vulnerable to combustion.

### Hydrology

Groundwater levels have been recorded at the nearby bore 61618500 since 1997 (Figure \ref{fig:WilgarupWaterPlot}). There has been a significant decline in groundwater levels throughout this monitoring period from 4.75 to 3.25 mAHD despite recent increased annual rainfall. Maximum and minimum seasonal groundwater levels have decreased by 1.6 and 1.2 m, respectively (Table \ref{tab:WilgarupWater}). Maximum water levels have consistently occurred during September-October, but minimum water levels are now occurring later in the year with the site experiencing a longer period of drying. The wetland has been non-compliant with ministerial thresholds for most of the monitoring period. A proposed threshold at 0.5 m lower than the current threshold is likely to be achievable under proposed reductions in abstraction by 2030. These changes in abstraction may result in small increases in groundwater levels, but are likely to reduce the risk of further declines.

### Vegetation dynamics

A vegetation monitoring transect was established at Lake Wilgarup in 1997 and was last surveyed in 2012. Two additional sites were added to the transect in 2009 down-slope of Plot A. The sedges, *Baumea articulata*, *Baumea juncea* and *Baumea vaginalis* have all disappeared from the wetland during the monitoring period (Figure \ref{fig:WilgarupStrat}). Tuart trees (*Eucalyptus gomphocephala*) have migrated down slope during the monitoring period and were recorded in Plot A in 2005. Plots A, B and C display similar shifts in community composition during the monitoring period, while Plot D displayed a significant change in composition in 2004-2005 in response to fire (Figure \ref{fig:WilgarupOrd}). Under a scenario of continuing groundwater decline, regressional analysis reveals that a number of exotic species, including *Ehrharta longiflora* and *Bromus diandrus*, are likely to increase in cover abundances (Figure \ref{fig:WilgarupPost}).

### Ramifications of revised thresholds

The site values of Lake Wilgarup are unlikely to be maintained under the proposed changes to groundwater abstraction (Table \ref{tab:WilgarupCompliance}). Vegetation composition has shifted from one dominated by wetland sepcies, such as *B. articulata*, to a terrestrial community dominated by *E. gomphocephala*. Increases in groundwater are unlikely to have an impact on the vegetation unless permanent water can be restored.

## Pipidinny Swamp

Vegetation damaged by a fire in 2005. Macroinvertebrate and water quality monitoring occurred in the 2000s but ceased in 2011 as the wetland was atypical and had little water. A single vegetation survey has been conducted in September 2019 and the results presented here.

### Hydrology

There has been at least a 2 m decline in surface water levels at Pipidinny Swamp since the mid 1990's, although measurements at the staff gauge were frequently below the minimum recordable level in the mid-late 2000's to 2019 despite the gauge being moved in 2010 (Figure \ref{fig:PipidinnyWaterPlot}). Mean maximum seasonal surface waters are at least 1.2 m lower now than in the 1994-1999 seasons (Table \ref{tab:PipidinnyWater}). Records of minimum levels are difficult to interpret due to the water levels frequently being below the staff gauge. Groundwater levels at the nearby bore 61611872 suggest that water levels at the swamp are no longer in decline, however this conclusion assumes groundwater levels at the bore and surface water levels at the staff gauge are related (Figure \ref{fig:PipidinnyWaterPlot}). It is not possible to verify this assumption as groundwater measurements have only been made while the surface water levels have been below detection limits for the staff gauge.

It is likely that water levels in Yanchep National Park will increase under the proposed 2030 changes in groundwater abstraction. The proposed threshold level of 1.1 m at bore 61611872 is likely to slightly increase or stabilise surface water levels in Pipidinny Swamp.

### Vegetation character

The transect at Pipidinny Swamp consists of a series of depressions/swamps interspersed with tracks and grassy banks. The transect was established close to the bore but was only 20 m in length due to the terrain. Subsequently, only four *Melaleuca* trees could be included. Species richness and diversity on and around the transect was low, with *Acacia saligna* the dominant overstorey species, although *Melaleuca rhaphiophylla* appeared in good health (both on and around the transect). *Baumea articulata* was present, albeit in low abundance, several meters up slope from the surface water, and was in moderate health with a couple of dead stems present. No recruitment was recorded. The location's potential value as important habitat was indicated by the presence of a south west carpet python (*Morelia apilota*) in amongst the *Typha orientalis* during the 2019 survey. A number of exotic species are abundant at the site, including *Bromus diandrus*, *Ehrharta longiflora* and the potentially invasive native bullrush *T. orientalis*.

### Ramifications of revised thresholds

The proposed reductions to abstraction are not likely to restore surface water levels to pre-2000 levels at Pipidinny Swamp which will effect the capacity maintaining the site values (Table \ref{tab:PipidinnyCompliance}). Features that charactersied this wetland before the significant decline in water levels are unlikely to return given the predicted outcomes of reduce abstraction as water levels will be maintained at levels much lower than was once typical of the wetland. However, the water levels are predicted to be slightly higher than current levels, which will have a beneficial effect on fringing vegetation health. Given the location of this swamp in an increasingly urbanised region and the altered hydrological regime, it is likely that exotic vegetation species will remain a feature of this swamp.

## Lexia 186

The Lexia 186 wetland has a high conservation value because it consists of a largely undisturbed sumpland habitat with a diverse vegetation community that provides significant habitat for fauna [@Froend2004]. The Lexia system of wetlands is composed of three separate wetlands, Lexia 86, Lexia 94 and Lexia 186. Lexia 186 was normally a seasonally waterlogged basin (Dampland), however, prolonged decline of groundwater levels mean water levels are now below the level of the basin all year. There has been dramatic shifts in fringing vegetation health and composition as the basin sediments dry and oxidise. 

### Hydrology

There has almost been a significant decline in groundwater levels at Lexia 186 from 1996 to 2015 by approximately 1 m and a significant increases in water levels since 2015 by 0.5 m (Figure \ref{fig:Lexia186WaterPlot}). Nonetheless, current mean maximum and minimum water levels are 1.2 and 0.8 m below 1994-1999 levels and seasonally minimums are occurring earlier in the year (Table \ref{tab:Lexia186Water}). Groundwater levels at Lexia 186 have been non-compliant since 2000. Proposed reductions in groundwater abstraction are not projected to increase water levels in the dampland, therefore a threshold 0.7 m below the current threshold has been proposed for 2030. This projection will maintain groundwater at similar levels to the period between 2010-2015.

### Vegetation dynamics

Vegetation monitoring has been occurring at Lexia 186 since 1997 with the last survey conducted in 2018 (Figure \ref{fig:Lexia186Strat}). Overall canopy health has remained stable with most *Melaleuca preissiana* in good or excellent condition and most *Banksia ilicifolia* with average condition [@Buller2018]. Exotic richness is very low at Lexia 186 and natives account for approximately 90 % of total cover abundance at the transect. Ordination reveals similar trajectories in compositional change for each plot that reflect the continual changes in cover abundances of species (Figure \ref{fig:Lexia186Ord}). Regression analyses did not reveal significant effects of groundwater levels on any of the species present at Lexia 186 (Figure \ref{fig:Lexia186Post}). This result suggests that community composition is changing due to other factors that are independent of groundwater level. This is surprising given the significant declines in groundwater at the site. Vegetation may being altered by other processes such as altered sediment processes and acidification.

### Ramifications of revised thresholds

The site values of the Lexia 186 wetland are unlikely to be maintained under the proposed changes to groundwater abstraction (Table \ref{tab:Lexia186Compliance}). There has been a significant shift from a seasonally waterlogged basin to a system that is now permentntly dry. The proposed reductions in abstraction are not going to restore this important characteristic of the wetland. Instead, predicted changes in water level suggest maintainence of conditions similar to what the site has experienced since 2011. It is likely that vegetation will undergo further shifts in composition, although it is not clear that these shifts are attributed to declining groundwater levels or other processes. Nonetheless, further monitoring will provide additional information as to whether the vegetation is likely to continue to change further.

## Melaleuca Park 173

Melaleuca Park 173 (EPP 173) is located within the Bassendean North Vegetation Complex and represents a regionally significant wetland [@Hill1996]. Normally, the site represents a permanently filled lake that is fed from a series of springs along the western margin of the basin [@Froend2004; @Judd2019]. The waters supported a rich macroinvertebrate community and an endemic population of the black-striped minnow (*Galaxiella nigrostriata*). There have been dramatic decreases in surface and groundwater levels in recent decades, to the point where the lake is almost dry during the summer months. Declining water levels are thought to have caused the local extinction of the black-striped minnow and degradation of fringing vegetation.

### Hydrology and water quality

There has been a prolonged decline in surface water levels since 1990 that show similar trends with fluctuations in groundwater levels (bore 61613213; Figure \ref{fig:EMP173WaterPlot}). Surface water level measurements are now unreliable at staff 6162628 due to water levels usually being below the minimum level of the staff. Since 2011, groundwater levels have been stable. Mean maximum and minimum water levels have decreased by 0.8 m and 0.5 m, respectively, since 1994 (Table \ref{tab:EMP173Water}). The latest 5 year period (2014-2019) suggests that groundwaters are reaching annual minimums earlier in the year than in previous seasons. Groundwater levels have been non-compliant during the monitoring period. The proposed threshold level of 48.5 mAHD is 1.7 m lower than the current threshold. Managing the wetland to these levels may result in further declines in water levels.

Melaleuca Park 173 is the only monitored wetland to show organic acidity [@Judd2019]. The waters are dark and have high gilvin levels (94.7 FTU). The acidic water have a pH between 3.4 and 5.1. Recent monitoring suggests current pH is low (3.7). The lake usually has total nitrogen levels between 2000 and 2800 $\mu$g/L.

### Vegetation dynamics

Vegetation monitoring has been occurring at Melaleuca Park from 1997 to 2018 [@Buller2019]. There has been marked changes in vegetation composition along the transect during this monitoring period (Figure \ref{fig:EMP173Strat}). In 2014, *Baumea articulata* was absent from the transect, however, due to a wet season which saw Plot A and B submerged in 2018, *B. articulata* was recorded in low abundance. Similar changes have been observed for *Astartea scoparia*, which prior to 2018 was recorded wither dead or in poor condition. Since 2018, many of the *A. scoparia* plants were observed with new shoots. Other important vegetation components in Plot A include *Lepidosperma longitudinale* and *Leptocarpus scariosus*, both of which are also present in Plot B, whilst the former is present throughout the transect. The long-term decline in water levels has had an adverse effect on the health of the *Melaleuca preissiana* population. Generally, this important canopy forming species has been declining in health, despite slight increases in plant health for 2018. The slight increase in *M. preissiana* health may be attributed to the recent stabilisation of groundwater in levels.

Ordination reveals distinct shifts in community composition since 1997 (Figure \ref{fig:EMP173Ord}). Although Plot A is distinct, in terms of vegetation cover abundances, to Plots B, C and D, all plots display an upwards trajectory along the second axis (LV2). For Plot A, this the shift in composition is likely due to the loss of *B. articulata* from the plot. Modeling compositional changes in vegetation with changes in groundwater levels suggests a number of species which are likely to increase in cover abundance with declining groundwater levels (Figure \ref{fig:EMP173Post}). These species, such as *Xanthorrhoea preissii* and *Dielsia stenostachya*, are likely to increase in cover abundance in lower areas of the basin under a scenario of continuing declining groundwater levels.

### Aquatic Invertebrates

Aquatic macroinvertebrate family richness has been declining since the late 2000's when water levels began declining (Figure \ref{fig:EMP173RichInv}). As water chemistry has changed little during this period, the decline in richness is likely due to the degradation of habitats caused by the lower surface waters and extended dry periods during summer (GMEMP 2019). Macroinvertebrate assemblage composition has shifted since the initial 2000 survey (Figure \ref{fig:EMP173OrdInv}). Since 2011, assemblage composition has been shifting away from the 2000 community, suggesting further shifts in composition are likely due to sustained low water levels. Taxa that have disappeared from the wetland include Chydoridae, Leptoceridae, Orthocladiinae and Unioncolidae (Figure \ref{fig:EMP173StratInv}).

### Ramifications of revised thresholds

It is likely that management many of the site values of the Melaleuca Park wetland will be achievable given the projected decline in groundwater levels (Table \ref{tab:EMP173Compliance}).

## Melaleuca Park 78

Melaleuca Park 78 (also referred to as EPP 78 or Dampland 78) is located north-west of the Lexia wetlands in the southern area of Melaleuca Park. The site is approximately 6.7 ha in area and represents a regionally significant wetland [@Hill1996]. Melaleuca Park 78 is classified as a Dampland habitat, meaning the basin has seasonally waterlogged soils that are not often inundated with surface waters [@Semeniuk1996]. The site is an important habitat for a unique assemblage of phreatophytic vegetation which provides important habitat for native populations of fauna.

### Hydrology

Water levels at the site have been declining since the beginning of monitoring in 1999 up until 2014, although absolute minimum levels were recorded in 2016. Bore 61613231 indicates that groundwaters in the dampland may have declined by about 1.3 m since 1999, although there has been a recent increase in groundwater levels since 2016 due to increased rainfall (Figure \ref{fig:EMP78WaterPlot}). Current 5 year mean maximum and minimum groundwater levels in the bore are about 1 m lower than when monitoring began in 1999, with peak levels occurring in October/November and minimums occurring between April-May (Table \ref{tab:EMP78Water}).

Groundwater levels have mostly been non-compliant since 2012 after a significant decline from 2009 levels. The effects of reduced abstraction are unlikely to arrest the decline in groundwater levels at this wetland. The proposed threshold is 0.4 m lower than the current threshold. Further declines in groundwater levels are expected by 2030 under a drying climate scenario.

### Vegetation dynamics

The vegetation transect has been monitored at Melaleuca Park 78 since 1997 and was last surveyed in 2018 (@Buller2019; Figure \ref{fig:EMP78Strat}). The site is largely dominated by native species that include a dense understorey of *Beaufortia elegans*, *Pultenea reticulata* and *Kunzea glabrescens*. The overstorey is largely composed of *Melaleuca preissiana* throughout the transect and *Banksia attenuata*, *Banksia ilicifolia* and *Banksia menziesii* in the higher parts of the basin. In 2006, the transect was heavily affected by a fire but the vegetation has since made some recovery. *Baumea articulata* disappeared from the transect during this period. A number of tree deaths were reported following the fire but there is evidence of recovery, particularly for low-lying stands of *M. preissiana*. Trajectories of compositional change provide further evidence for post-fire recovery as recent plot assemblages are becoming more similar to those recorded before the fire (Figure \ref{fig:EMP78Ord}).

Bayesian regression modelling suggests a number of species associated with low groundwater levels (Figure \ref{fig:EMP78Post}). In particular, some natives, including *B. attenuata*, *Hibbertia subvaginata* and *M. preissiana*, are likely to increase in cover abundance under a scenario of further decreasing groundwaters. The cover abundance of exotics, including *Aira caryophyllea*, *Briza maxima*, *Ehrharta calycina*, *Hypochaeris glabra*, *Poa annua*, *Sonchus oleraceus* and *Ursinia anthemoides*, are also likely to increase in cover abundance withd declining groundwaters. Some of the species are groundwater dependent, such as the *Banksia* species, suggesting that despite being in decline, groundwater will remain important in determining the vegetation composition of the wetland It is also likely that the richness of exotic species will increase with groundwater decline as the site becomes invaded by exotics not currently recorded at the site.

### Ramifications of revised thresholds

Further declines in groundwater levels will make it unlikely that site values will be maintained at Melaleuca Park 78 (Table \ref{tab:EMP78Compliance}).

## MM59B - Whiteman Park East

### Hydrology

Groundwater levels at Whiteman Park East have been declining since 1980, although this decline seems to have stabilised since 2010 (Figure \ref{fig:MM59BWaterPlot}). Current 5-year mean maximum and minimum   water levels are 0.9 and 0.6 m lower than 1994-1999 levels, respectively (Table \ref{tab:MM59BWater}). Minimum water levels occur in June, while maximums are usually reached in October.

### Vegetation

The site contains a fairly sparse understorey and open mixed woodland canopy consisting of *Banksia* spp, *Allocasuarina fraseriana*, *Nuytsia floribunda* and *Eucalyptus todtiana*. *Banksia* species found at the site include *B. attenuata*, *B. ilicifolia* and *B. menziesii*. Vegetation is slightly degraded with signs of rabbits evident. Species richness and diversity are notably less than some of the other Pinjar sites and more exotic species, such as *Ursinia anthemoides*, are present at high cover abundances. Predominant native understorey species include *Scholtzia involucrata*, *Calytrix* spp. and *Patersonia occidentalis*. *Banksia* spp. health was mostly good, although some *B. attenuata* appeared to be approaching senescence, and a number of dead *Banksia* are also present. Recruitment was present but low.

## PM9 - Pinjar North

Copied from quote - "Water levels at PM9 have been monitored since 1976 and have fallen approx. 7 meters over this time. It is assumed that vegetation at this site is now no longer able to access groundwater. The nearest vegetation monitoring transect is ‘P50’, located near the Water Corporation’s P50 production bore east of Lake Pinjar, approximately 2.2 km away to the south-west. The P50 transect has been subjected to different influences over the years, including (previous) pumping of the P50 production bore and widespread deaths of vegetation following a succession of high temperatures in the early 1990s, and several fires. There has been an increase in the frequency and cover of species that prefer ‘broad’ site conditions, and an increase in the relative proportion of cover from introduced species. There is a consistent decline on the transect in species preferring excessive wetness." 

WHERE IS VEGETARTION TRANSECT AT P50?

### Hydrology

Groundwater at PM9 have almost continually been in decline since 1980 from approximately 59 mAHD to 2016 levels around 53 mAHD (Figure \ref{fig:PM9WaterPlot}). The most significant rate of decline has been occurring since 1995 to 2016. Maximum and minimal seasonal water levels are 4 and 5 m lower now than in the 1994-1999 period, respectively (Table \ref{tab:PM9water}). Since 2016, no measurements at bore 61610804 have been made due to the operation of a nearby rifle range. It is unknown if groundwater levels have continued to decline since 2016 because no measurements have been recorded due to safety concerns regarding access to the bore. If the observed decline has continued, groundwater levels at the site may currently be below 52 mAHD, representing more than a 7 m decline since 1980.

## WM1 - Pinjar

WM1 is located east of Lake Pinjar in the Chitty Road Bushland within the Bassendean north vegetation complex. Water levels at WM1 have been non-compliant since 2001.

### Hydrology

Groundwater levels at WM1 have declined up to 4.0 m since 1980, although recent rainfall has increased levels from 54.4 to 55.5 mAHD since 2015 (Figure \ref{fig:WM1WaterPlot}). Current mean maximum and minimum water levels are 2.0 and 1.7 m lower than 1994-1999 levels (Table \ref{tab:WM1Water}). Maximum water levels generally occur in October and minimum water levels are now occurring later in the year than previously.

### Vegetation character

The area has been affected by fire in the past (sometime between early Jan 2015 and late February 2015) and some of the older *Banksias* on the transect have old fire scars. Vegetation structure and community composition of the site is typical *Banksia* woodland, consisting of overstorey species *B. attenuata*, *B. menziesii* and *B. ilicifolia* and a typically diverse dry land understorey of *Acacia pulchella*, *Adenanthos cygnorum*, *Jacksonia* spp and *Xanthorrhoea preissii*. Although not recorded in the transect, *Melaleuca preissiana* has been noted nearby. In general, *Banksia* health appears good despite several individuals having significant insect damage and yellow leaves. Previous reports have document the decline of vegetation at this site due to declining groundwater levels [@WaterandRiversCommission2004; @DepartmentofWater2008]. The trends included a general thinning of the understory, *B. attenuata* deaths, declining condition of *B. ilicifolia* and *B. menziessi*. *Eucalyptus todtiana* and *Corymbia calophylla* have also been reported to be declining in health in 2008 [@DepartmentofWater2008].

## WM2 - Melaleuca Park North

Located in Melaleuca Park in the Bassendean north vegetation complex, the area represents an area of undisturbed phreatophytic vegetation, including *Banksia* woodlands (REPORT 82392).

### Hydrology

There has been periods of significant decline in groundwater levels from 68.8 mAHD in 1980 to 66.4 mAHD in 2014 (Figure \ref{fig:WM2WaterPlot}). Since 2015, there has been an increase in groundwater to slightly above 67 mAHD. Mean maximum and minimum seasonal water levels are now 1.5 and 0.9 m lower than the period 1994-1999. Maximum levels have consistently been reached in October, on average (Table \ref{tab:WM2Water}). 

### Vegetation character

The vegetation around monitoring bore WM2 has similar vegetation composition as WM1. The vegetation also appears to have been affected by fire in the summer of 2014/2015. The understorey is highly diverse, with *Acacia pulchella*, *Adenanthos cygnorum* and *Xanthorrhoea preissii* common. Canopy cover is quite open, with several mature *Banksias* present. Most *Banksias* were resprouts and/or young trees between 1 and 3 m tall. Several mature trees bore significant epicormic growth. New *Banksia* recruitment (mainly very small seedlings) for *Banksia attenuata* and *Banksia menziessi* has been observed.

## WM8 - Melaleuca Park

The WM8 monitoring bore is located in Melaleuca Park within the Bassendean north vegetation complex and represents native vegetation that may be affected by abstraction from the Lexia groundwater scheme. There has been no reported change in vegetation at the site, although no monitoring or transects have been established here.

### Hydrology

Groundwater levels began to decline in 2000 at WM8 from approximately 66.0 mAHD to 64.6 mAHD in 2015 (Figure \ref{fig:WM8WaterPlot}). Since 2015, there has been an increase in groundwater levels to approximately 65.5 mAHD. Mean maximum and minimum seasonal water levels have declined by 1.3 and 1.0 m, respectively (Table \ref{tab:WM8Water}). Maximum levels are generally reached in December while minimum levels are reached in July.

### Vegetation character

The vegetation community at WM8 is typical of *Banksia* woodland. There is a sparse understorey composed predominately of *Lyginia barbata*, *Scholtzia involucrata* and *Eremaea pauciflora*. The canopy is open and consists predominately of *Banksia attenuata* and *B. menziesii*. Tree health at the site was good although a number of dead mature *Banksias* were present. There is evidence of recent *Banksia attenuata* recruitment, mainly in the form of small seedlings. *Jacksonia floribunda* in notably poorer health than at the other Pinjar sites (WM1 and WM2).

## Lake Gwelup

Lake Gwelup is a shallow groundwater system located in the highly urbanised area of Gwelup/Karrinyup. The lake is permanently inundated and provides important habitat to a variety of fauna and fringing vegetation. The wetland is not currently a Ministerial criteria site.

### Hydrology

Lake water levels were first monitored in 1960, but regular monitoring has occurred between 1967 and 1988, and from 1999 until the present. Lake levels in the 1970s and 1980s were 1m to 2m higher than in the 2000s (Figure \ref{fig:GwelupWaterPlot}). They have risen again since 2013 following a reduction in nearby public water supply abstraction, and levels are currently similar to levels in the 1980s and 1990's (Table \ref{tab:GwelupWater}). The nearby bore 61610032 has been monitored since 1972. Water levels at the bore have declined by around 4 meters since the start of monitoring. Levels have been reasonably stable since the early 2000s and have trended slightly upwards since 2011.

### Vegetation dynamics

Vegetation monitoring at Lake Gwelup began in 2013 and was last conducted in 2017. The start of the transect was inundated by approximately 0.7 m of surface water during the 2017 survey. The wetland is dominated by exotic species such as *Cynodon dactylon* and *Ehrharta calycina* despite exotic cover abundance declining in the later surveys (Figure \ref{fig:GwelupStrat}). The overstorey is dominated by the natives *Eucalyptus rudis* and *Maleleuca rhaphiophyla* which are in good health [@Buller2018]. There was a dramatic shift in community composition between 2014 and 2017 due to inundation of the plots (Figure \ref{fig:GwelupOrd}). Bayesian regression analysis reveals that a number of exotic species will continue to decrease in cover abundances with the higher water levels (Figure \ref{fig:GwelupPost}).

## Quin Brook

Quin Brook is a base flow system where surface flow, riparian vegetation and habitat maintenance all depend on groundwater [@Froend2004a]. The series of interconnected ponds that occur along Quin Brook are of high conservation value because of the pristine nature of the fringing vegetation and the aquatic associated fauna likely to inhabit the surface waters and riparian zones.

### Hydrology

The hydrology of Quin Brook is not well understood. Stretches of the brook are dry most of the year and may have previously been supported by groundwater [@Johnson2000]. Near the confluence with Gingin Brook, flow is maintained throughout the year by groundwater with winter discharge an important source of fill for Lake Yeal [@DepartmentofWater2011]. Groundwater levels at bore 61710060 have been in constant decline since the early 1980's from approximately 59.5 mAHD to current levels at 53.8 m AHD (Figure \ref{fig:QuinBrookWaterPlot}). Mean maximum and minimum groundwater levels are now nearly 5.0 m below 1994-1999 levels with seasonal patterns almost indistinguishable (Table \ref{tab:QuinBrookWater}).

### Vegetation dynamics

Vegetation at Quin Brook is dominated by some key wetland species, including *Melaleuca rhaphiophyla*, *Eucalyptus rudis*, *Banksia littoralis* and *Melaleuca preissiana*. Vegetation monitoring, which began in 2009, indicates that the *Melaleuca* species have declined significantly in cover abundance to the point where it is no longer present in the higher levels of the transect (Figure \ref{fig:QuinStrat}). Cover abundance of *E. rudis* has remained relatively stable despite the health of individual trees declining [@Buller2019]. Other abundant species at the site include *Astartea scoparia*, *Hypocalymna angustifolium* and *Kunzea glabrescens*. All plots along the vegetation monitoring transect have shifted in composition since 2009, mainly due to the decline in *M. rhaphiophyla* and *M. preissiana* (Figure \ref{fig:QuinOrd}). Many species are likely to increase in cover abundances with groundwater level decline, including an exotic grass (probably *Vulpia* sp.), the exotic *Sonchus asper* and *Lotus angustissimus* (Figure \ref{fig:QuinPost}). Some natives associated with lower groundwater levels include *Senecio* sp., *Pteridium esculentum* and *Hypolaena exsulca*.

## Gingin Brook

Gingin Brook is a new proposed site in the Gingin water allocation plan (draft expected 2023). There is currently no baseline vegetation data for the site.

### Hydrology

Groundwaters at this site have significantly declined during the period between 1989 and 2015 by approximately 2.5 m (Figure \ref{fig:GinginWaterPlot}). Mean seasonal maximum and minimum groundwater levels have also decreased by 1.8 since 1994, with current monthly minimums generally occurring earlier in the year than in between 1994 and 1999 (Table \ref{tab:GinginWater}).

|Wetland  | Current Threshold (mAHD) | Proposed Threshold (mAHD) | Ecological consequences |
| :------------ | :-----------: | :------: | :------------ |
|Lake Goollelal|26.0|26.4|The lake will remain permanently inundated at similar levels as present. Fringing vegetation will persist and provide habitat for the current diversity of aquatic invertebrates. The site will continue acting as a drought refuge for water birds and provide important habitat to important native fish species.|
|Loch McNess|6.95|6.20|Declines in groundwater have caused major shifts in vegetation and aquatic invertebrate communities. In particular, the unique assemblage of macroinvertebrates present within the lake has been replaced by common taxa and nuisance species. Declining water levels have also caused the disappearance of *B. articulata*, an important fringing macrophyte. Declining water levels have also caused significant increases in nutrient levels and sustained low water levels are likely to have serious consequences for an important population of Rakali. Under the revised abstraction plans, these ecological shifts are likely to persist into the future and typical characteristics and ecological processes once a feature of the system before the 2003 water level decline will not return. |
|Lake Yonderup|5.9|5.7|The stable hydrological regime is not likely to return to this wetland if the wetland remains non-compliant with the current ministerial threshold. Nonetheless, the aquatic macroinvertebrate community has remained relatively stable in composition, a feature likely to persist if further declines do not occur. Further declines in water level before 2028 may cause significant changes in water quality, especially nitrogen levels, which may impact aquatic invertebrate communities before the revised thresholds are applicable. Higher water levels than current (approximate minimum levels of 5.5 mAHD) may have beneficial effects for surrounding *Banksia* woodland and fringing vegetation. |
|Lake Joondalup|15.8|16.2|The proposed thresholds will see water levels maintained at levels higher than current levels. This will have a positive impacts for fringinge sedge vegetation and fish and bird habitat. There is the possibility that terrestrial vegetation occuring at higher elevations in the absin, may be squeezed as further migration up-slope become hampered by surrounding urbanisation. Nutrient enrichment remains an issue for the lake and further increases in nutrient levels may cause a shift in ecological processes and change the character of the lake. |
|Lake Mariginiup|41.5|42.1|The predicted increases in water levels may be sufficient to halt acidification of the lake. It is possible to restore the water quality of the lake, but this requires the sediments to have sufficient capacity to buffer the acidification once re-wetted. Nonetheless, if acidification cannot be reveresed, the current assemblage of macro-invertebrates is likely to persist. The proposed changes to groundwater levels will enhance the extent of habitat available to wading birds and, over a period of decades, restore *E. rudis* woodland. Given the decline in water level and the acidification that has occured, it is unlikely that the native fish *P. olorum* is locally extinct from the lake and will not return unless water quality is restored and it is able to immigrate back to the lake. |
|Lake Jandabup|44.3|44.3|Acidification is currently causing a decrease in richness of the aquatic macroinvertebrate communities, and the proposed changes in water level are not likely to effect this process. Otherwise, the poredicted increases in surface water levels will have a beneficial effect on native vegetation, sedges and wader bird habitat. Elevated nutrient levels may continue to remain a concern.|
|Lake Nowergup|16.8|16.0|Declining surface water levels at this wetland are going to contribute further to the ecological decline of this wetland. Areas of wetland vegetation are very likely to become terrestrialised, while the extent of exsisting sedge vegetation is going to be greatly reduced. The capacity of this wetland to act as a drought refuge for birds will be diminished and habitat for native fish species will be at increased risk of disappearance.|
|Lake Wilgarup|4.5|3.9|Lake Wilgarup, as a wetland, has been severely compromised by a combination of declining groundwater levels and fire. The site no longer resembles a wetland and is dominated by terrestrial woodland vegetation. The proposed changes to groundwater level are unlikely to prevent further terrestrialisation of this site.|
|Pipidinny Swamp|1.6|1.1|Aquatic macroinvertebrate communities have been seriosly comprimised at Pipidinny Swamp due to falling water levels. Although the proposed changes to abstraction may cause water levels to be managed at levels higher than currently exsists, this state will be much lower than pre-2000 levels. The proposed changes to abstraction are unlikley restore the aquatic macroinvertebrate communities to what was once typical of the swamp, and exotic plants will remain a feature of the vegetation community. Nonetheless, fringing vegetation is likely to persist and continue to provide habitat for aquatic fauna.|
|Lexia 186|47.2|46.5|A significant shift in hydrological regime has occured at Lexia 186. The site has been transformed from a seasonally water logged dampland to a system where saturation of surface sediments no longer occurs. Despite the declining ground water levels, shifts in vegetation composition are likely to be driven by other processes. The site has retained the high richness of native species and is still an important habitat for fauna. The proposed changes to the threshold are likely to maintain the system at a state that currently exsists.|
